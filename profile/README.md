## üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Video Processing** | Python + AWS | Pipeline for transcoding, transcription, AI analysis |

| **Infrastructure** | Terraform + AWS/Cloudflare | Infrastructure as Code |

## üîÑ Developer Workflow

Our development process is optimized for working with Claude AI and follows a structured approach:

### Context Management
- Use `/clear` in Claude to start fresh between tasks or GitHub issues
- Reference documents with `@` symbol to add relevant context
- Focus on one task at a time to maintain accuracy

### Required Documents
Create and maintain these key documents in each repository:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Instructions for Claude on authentication, workflows, and restrictions
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - System architecture, data flow diagrams, and component descriptions  
- **`spec/*.md`** - Detailed specifications for individual system components
- **`README.md`** - Human-readable documentation for setup and deployment

### Planning Workflow
1. **Create GitHub Issue** - Describe use case, desired outcome, and implementation approach
2. **Planning Mode** - Work with Claude to develop detailed implementation plan
3. **Save Plan** - Document plan in the GitHub issue
4. **Track Progress** - Update issues as work progresses

### GitHub Workflow
1. **Branch Protection** - Never edit files directly on main branch
2. **Issue ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Branch** - Create new branch for each planned task
3. **Commits** - Have Claude handle commits with descriptive messages
4. **Pull Request** - Create as draft, get Copilot review, get `/security-review` address findings (write agents for this in the future)
5. **Documentation Updates** - Update ARCHITECTURE.md including diagrams, spec files, and README as needed
6. **Merge** - Merge to main after testing and documentation updates

### Best Practices
- **One Task Focus** - Complete one GitHub issue/task before starting another
- **Document Everything** - Keep design documents current with implementation
- **Test Before Deploy** - Validate all changes before merging
- **Review Process** - Use Copilot for PR reviews and address all findings

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Video Processing (oneup-pipeline)
```bash
# Set up AWS credentials and environment
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile
export STAGE=dev

# Use CLI tools for testing pipeline components
cd content_safety_screening/cli && python safety_screening_cli.py --interactive
cd transcoding && python transcoding_cli.py --interactive
```

### For Backend Development (oneup-backend)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run deploy
```

### Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI** - Configured with appropriate credentials
- **wrangler** - For Cloudflare deployments
- **Node.js** - For TypeScript/Vue.js development
- **Python** - For video processing pipeline
- **Terraform** - For infrastructure management
